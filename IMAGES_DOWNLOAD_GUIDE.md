## Steps to Download:

### Method 1: From Itch.io Page (Recommended)
1. Visit each game's itch.io page
2. Right-click on the cover/banner image
3. Select "Save image as..."
4. Save to the `images/` folder with the exact filename listed above
5. Preferred format: JPG or PNG (JPG recommended for smaller file size)

### Method 2: From Your Game Dashboard
1. Go to https://itch.io/dashboard
2. Click on each game
3. In the "Edit game" section, you can download your uploaded cover images
4. Save them with the filenames listed above

## Image Specifications:
- **Recommended size**: 700-1000px width

## After Downloading:
Once you have all 3 images in the `images/` folder, your portfolio will display them automatically. The images are already referenced in the HTML.

## Optional: Create Placeholder Images
If you want to test the layout before adding real images, you can create simple placeholder images:
- 700x400px colored rectangles with game titles
- Use any image editor or online tool like https://placeholder.com/
